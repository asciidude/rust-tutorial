# Contribution Agreement
To contribute the only thing you are allowed to do would be to update outdated code, improve efficiency, or 
add comments to the code that I have missed.

## Formatting
To format your PR, provide a list of what you changed or added and __do not__ miss out on anything.

## Redness Level
If you have recieved a "redness level" from me (ranging from 0-10), that means I suspect you have tried injecting
malicious code into the tutorial. If so, your pull request would likely not be accepted.

## Bans
Much like redness level, I know you have injected malicious code or posted spam on the PR, ultimately leading to you
being banned from any PRs being accepted.
